# 🚪 API Gateway 

## 📌 What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a centralized entry point between clients and backend services.  
It acts as a **reverse proxy**, routing requests and handling authentication, SSL, throttling, caching, logging, and monitoring — while hiding internal system complexity.

## 📌 How an API Gateway Works

It manages incoming requests and performs:

- Authentication
- SSL termination
- Routing to services
- Rate limiting and traffic control
- Protocol translation
- Caching and aggregation

## 🧠 How It Processes a Request

1. **User request sent from client (web/mobile).**
2. **Gateway checks which service the request belongs to.**
3. **Authentication (User ID/Password, OAuth, JWT).**
4. **SSL (Secure Socket Layer) establishes encrypted connection.**
5. **Routing & Transformation**
6. **Aggregation of multiple service responses if required.**
7. **Response sent back to client.**

## 📌 Key Responsibilities of an API Gateway

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Routing** | Sends incoming requests to the correct backend service. |
| **Protocol Translation** | Converts formats: HTTP → WebSocket / gRPC, etc. |
| **Request Aggregation** | Combines responses from multiple services. |
| **Authentication / Authorization** | Uses OAuth, API keys, JWT, etc. |
| **Rate Limiting / Throttling** | Prevents abuse and controls traffic. |
| **Load Balancing** | Distributes traffic across multiple service instances. |
| **Caching** | Improves speed by reusing previous responses. |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | Tracks usage, failures, and performance metrics. |

## 🏗️ API Gateway in Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

| Aspect | Monolithic Architecture | Microservices Architecture |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Request Routing** | Routes to different modules of one app. | Routes to multiple independent microservices. |
| **Service Discovery** | Not needed. | Needed to locate services dynamically. |
| **Authorization Complexity** | Simple, single system. | Complex—multiple services require verification. |
| **Load Balancing** | Simple. | Balances multiple services & instances. |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Less complex. | Critical to isolate failures. |

## 🛍️ Example: API Gateway in Microservices

<img width="801" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/321f4802-9d1c-4f85-aeba-8dee58fcfe26" />

✔ Gateway routes requests to services like User, Cart, Orders, Payment  
✔ Handles auth, rate limits, caching, transformations  
✔ Standardized responses returned to client

## 🧱 Example: API Gateway in Monolith

<img width="801" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb0ba36-756f-4143-b7a6-679c1251e4e4" />

✔ Still used as a single secure entry point  
✔ Handles SSL, auth, throttling, versioning, caching

## Best practices for implementing API Gateway
Below are the best practices for API Gateway:

- Security: To prevent abuse, utilize SSL/TLS for encryption, implement strong authentication and authorization methods, and use IP whitelisting and rate limiting.
- Performance Optimization: Reduce latency and speed up response times by utilizing caching, request/response compression, and effective routing.
- Scalability: Design for horizontal scalability, use load balancing, and monitor performance metrics to scale resources as needed.
- Monitoring and Logging: Use monitoring tools to track performance indicators, interface with logging and monitoring systems for centralized management, and implement extensive logging.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms and use standardized error codes and messages for consistency.
- Versioning and Documentation: Maintain backward compatibility and manage changes with versioning. Also, keep documentation updated so developers can learn how to use the API.

## ⭐ Benefits of using API Gateway

- Centralized access control
- Enhanced security (Auth, SSL, DDoS protection)
- Faster responses via caching & aggregation
- Easier scaling and service management
- Reduces client complexity

## ⚠️ Challenges of using API Gateway

- Can become a **single point of failure**
- May introduce **latency**
- Configuration and scaling may be **complex**
- Needs continuous **security updates**
