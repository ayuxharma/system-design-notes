# Introduction to System Design

**System Design** is the process of designing the **architecture**, **components**, and **interfaces** of a system so that it meets the end-user requirements.

It involves taking a **problem statement**, breaking it down into smaller components, and designing each component to work together effectively to achieve the overall goal of the system.

In software engineering, system design is a **high-level design phase** that focuses on how the overall software system will be structured — including its architecture, components, and interactions.

## Simple Analogy

**Coding** = building a single room  
**System design** = designing an entire building
