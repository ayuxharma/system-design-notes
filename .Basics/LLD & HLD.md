# System Design – Introduction

**System design** is the process of **planning**, **structuring**, and **defining** the architecture of a software system.  
It creates a blueprint of how components interact, how data flows, and how the system meets all requirements.

## 📌 System Design in SDLC

In the **System Design Life Cycle**, the design phase is essential before implementation or testing.  
It forms the **backbone** of the system because it defines:

- business logic  
- component interactions  
- handling of exceptional scenarios

# 🔹 High-Level Design (HLD)

Defines the **overall architecture** of the system:

- major components  
- how they interact  
- data flow  
- system structure and major decisions  

**Done by:** architects, managers, stakeholders.

---

# 🔹 Low-Level Design (LLD)

Defines the **internal details** of each component:

- class diagrams  
- APIs  
- database schemas  
- internal logic & algorithms  

**Done by:** senior developers, system designers.

# ⭐ Key Considerations in System Design

- **Scalability:** Must handle increased load (horizontal/vertical scaling).  
- **Performance:** Low latency, fast response, efficient processing.  
- **Reliability:** Minimal failures, consistent behavior.  
- **Security:** Protect data and prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Maintainability:** Easy to update, debug, and extend.  
- **Interoperability:** Works smoothly with other systems.  
- **Usability:** Intuitive and user-friendly.  
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Optimized development and operational cost.
